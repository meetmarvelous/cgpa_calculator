**Calculating GPA and CGPA:**

The process for calculating GPA and CGPA is consistent across all these systems, only the grade point values differ.

* **GPA (Grade Point Average):** Calculated for each semester.
    $$\text{GPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{Grade Point for Course} \times \text{Credit Units for Course})}{\text{Total Credit Units for the Semester}}$$

* **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average):** Calculated across all semesters.
    $$\text{CGPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{Grade Point for all Courses} \times \text{Credit Units for all Courses})}{\text{Total Credit Units for all Semesters}}$$

In essence, for each course, the grade point earned is multiplied by the course's credit units. These values are summed for a semester to get the total quality points for that semester. Dividing this by the total credit units for the semester yields the GPA. The CGPA is the cumulative version of this calculation across all completed semesters.
